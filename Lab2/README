Final code from Lab 2: Memory Performance.

The task was to optimize a basic implementation of an image manipulation parser and have it run as fast as we could.

Final implementation was ~1130x faster than the original.

The optimizations made were:

1. Minimizing multiplications in the code
2. Removing extraneous shifts on the white pixels
3. Consolidating all transformations into one set that is done at the end of each batch of 25
4. Minor loop unrolling and LICM
